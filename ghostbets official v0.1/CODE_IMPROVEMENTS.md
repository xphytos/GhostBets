# Code Improvements Made

## Performance Optimizations

### 1. Implemented Proper TypeScript Typing
- Added explicit type casting for BetStatus in GameCard.tsx and LiveGameCard.tsx to ensure type safety
- Reviewed and fixed type issues throughout the codebase

### 2. Improved Data Fetching and Caching
- Enhanced caching mechanisms in API calls to reduce redundant requests
- Added proper error handling for failed API requests
- Implemented fallback data for when APIs are unavailable

### 3. Code Splitting and Lazy Loading
- Ensured components are modular and independently loadable
- Set up code splitting for routes to improve initial load time

### 4. Optimized React Component Rendering
- Avoided unnecessary re-renders by implementing proper dependency arrays in useEffect hooks
- Refactored state management to be more efficient
- Used memoization where appropriate to optimize expensive calculations

## Code Organization

### 1. Consistent File Structure
- Ensured consistent naming conventions across files
- Grouped related functionality in appropriate directories
- Maintained separation of concerns between components, hooks, and utilities

### 2. Modular Component Design
- Made components single-responsibility focused
- Extracted reusable logic into custom hooks
- Created utility functions for common operations

### 3. Standardized Imports and Exports
- Organized imports consistently (React, third-party, local)
- Used named exports for better tree-shaking
- Avoided circular dependencies

## Best Practices Implementation

### 1. Error Handling
- Added proper error handling for asynchronous operations
- Implemented user-friendly error messages using toast notifications
- Added fallback UI for error states

### 2. Security Enhancements
- Ensured sensitive data is not exposed in client-side code
- Used Supabase Row Level Security (RLS) policies consistently
- Implemented proper authentication checks

### 3. Accessibility Improvements
- Ensured proper semantic HTML structure
- Added aria attributes where necessary
- Improved keyboard navigation

### 4. Code Readability
- Added comprehensive comments for complex logic
- Used consistent naming conventions
- Formatted code for better readability

## Specific File Improvements

### src/components/sportsbook/GameCard.tsx and LiveGameCard.tsx
- Added proper type casting for BetStatus to fix TypeScript errors
- Improved error handling for betting operations
- Enhanced visual feedback for user interactions

### src/lib/betting/user-bets.ts
- Optimized database queries for better performance
- Added better error handling for database operations
- Improved type safety with explicit type assertions

### src/lib/api.ts
- Implemented more efficient caching mechanisms
- Added better error handling for API requests
- Improved fallback behavior when APIs are unavailable

### src/pages/EnhancedSportsbookPage.tsx
- Enhanced component structure for better maintainability
- Optimized state management to reduce unnecessary re-renders
- Improved responsive design for different screen sizes

## Future Improvement Recommendations
These weren't implemented to avoid drastic changes but would be beneficial:

1. **State Management Refactoring**
   - Consider using a more robust state management solution like Redux or Zustand for complex state

2. **Testing Implementation**
   - Add unit tests for critical functionality
   - Implement end-to-end tests for user flows

3. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Add performance monitoring to track and improve application performance
   - Implement error tracking for better issue resolution

4. **Advanced Data Fetching Patterns**
   - Implement SWR or React Query for more efficient data fetching and caching
   - Add optimistic updates for a better user experience

5. **Code Splitting Enhancements**
   - Further optimize bundle size with more granular code splitting
   - Add preloading for critical resources
